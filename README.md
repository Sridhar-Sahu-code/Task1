 Data Cleaning Steps Performed:
 <br>
  1.🧹 Removed Rows with Missing Values:
<br>
-  Price per Unit had 2 missing values.
<br>
-  These rows were removed to ensure data completeness.
<br>
  2.📊 Corrected Data Types:
<br>
Columns like Price per Unit, Total Sales, and Operating Profit were stored as text (object).
<br>
These were converted to numeric types for proper analysis and visualization.
<br>
Units Sold was also fixed from text to integer.
<br>
  3.📅 Standardized Date Format:
<br>
The Invoice Date column was renamed to Invoice date and standardized for consistency (likely cleaned from inconsistent date formats to a uniform format like dd-mm-yyyy).
<br>
  4.🗑️ Removed Unnecessary Formatting or Characters:
<br>
Any extra symbols (like $, commas in numbers) were removed from numeric columns.
<br>
This helped convert them cleanly into usable numerical data types.
<br>
  5.🔁 Verified Duplicates:
<br>
No duplicate rows were found in either the raw or cleaned dataset.

🧾 Standardized Column Names:

Ensured column names were clean and consistent (e.g., fixed capitalization or spaces).
